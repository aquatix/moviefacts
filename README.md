# moviefacts
Query a cached version of ~~IMDb~~ The Movie Database content, giving quotes, synopsis, trivia and such for movies and series.

~~Import plain text data files from [IMDb's alternative interfaces page](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces)~~ Crawl The Movie Database API and search through the movies via a JSON API, or request random movies with facts for use in guessing/trivia games.

Why not use IMDb's content? IMDb makes it really difficult to use their data files, now even resorting to having people pay for the downloads through Amazon pay-per-download buckets. The Movie Database on the other hand provides a really good service, clear API and is friendly to projects copying their data, as long as one attributes the content to them of course.
